Expectations are special purpose functions that can be used alongside `.toEqual` when checking object deep equality. Sometimes you don't want specify directly a value that you check. Expectations allow you to say something about the value without necessarily specifying the value itself.

All expectations can be combined with the `.not` modifier.
